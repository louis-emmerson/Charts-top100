## Features
1. **Favorite Albums**
Users can mark albums as their favorites and filter to view only their selected favorites. Favorites are stored using the browser's local storage, ensuring that they remain available even after the user closes or refreshes the app.

2. **Country-Based Chart Filtering**
Users can switch between the top 100 charts for different countries via a filter in the header. Changing the selected country updates the API endpoint dynamically, displaying the albums specific to the chosen country.

3. **Album and Track Interaction**
Clicking on an album displays its list of tracks with audio previews. Users can then listen to a 30-second preview of each track directly within the app.
